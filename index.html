{% include crisis_index.html %}

{% comment %}
    Switch the above include between crisis_index.html and
    standard_index.html.

    `crisis_index.html` is map-oriented, and includes the blurb of the latest
    news item. `standard_index.html` has a smaller map, and has the full
    versions of the most recent posts from all categories.
